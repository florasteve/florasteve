## 💼 2025 Internship with InfusionPoints
During my internship at **InfusionPoints**, I supported cross-functional teams across the **Security Operations Center (SOC), Advisory, Cloud Operations, and Engineering** departments. This role provided hands-on exposure to cloud security, compliance, and operations in a consulting environment serving both commercial and federal clients.  

Key contributions included:  
- **Compliance & Documentation:** Conducted research, compiled data, and assisted in the development of security and compliance documentation aligned with **FedRAMP 20X, DoD IL4/IL5, CMMC, and CSP/APN partner requirements**.  
- **Technical Support & Training:** Completed structured onboarding modules and earned **AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner** and **AWS Solutions Architect – Associate** certifications, reinforcing my technical foundation in cloud architecture and migration.  
- **Collaboration & Process Improvement:** Worked alongside interns and senior staff on **automation initiatives and process-improvement projects**, contributing ideas to enhance internal workflows and client deliverables.  
- **Engagement & Professionalism:** Actively participated in daily and weekly meetings, documented key action items, and consistently maintained professionalism in alignment with company policies, confidentiality agreements (NDA), and cultural values.  

This internship enabled me to integrate my academic knowledge with practical experience, strengthen my understanding of cloud security and compliance frameworks, and gain a clearer perspective on how cloud engineering, cybersecurity, and compliance intersect in a professional setting.
