## üß≠ Professional Overview
I am a graduate of Appalachian State University with a degree in **Computer Information Systems (BSBA)**, possessing a strong foundation in **IT infrastructure, cloud computing, and cybersecurity**. My background includes practical experience configuring and managing **Windows Server 2022 environments, Active Directory, DNS, DHCP, and SQL databases**. This experience is complemented by exposure to **AWS-native solutions** during my internship with **InfusionPoints**.  

I hold industry-recognized certifications, including **AWS Certified Solutions Architect ‚Äì Associate** and **AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner**, as well as **CompTIA A+ and ITF+**, **Fortinet NSE 1 & 2**, and **SQL (Beginner & Intermediate)**. These certifications demonstrate both my technical expertise and my dedication to ongoing professional development.  

Currently, I am expanding my hands-on capabilities through a portfolio of projects in **cloud engineering, DevOps, and database design**. I am also exploring how **Artificial Intelligence can be integrated with cloud and cybersecurity solutions**, particularly in areas such as automation, compliance, and threat detection. My goal is to leverage my certifications, IT foundation, and adaptability to contribute to building secure, scalable, and forward-looking systems.

## üë§ Who I Am
I am a **dedicated and detail-oriented IT professional** who excels at the intersection of **infrastructure, cloud, and security**. My professional journey has emphasized adaptability and growth‚Äîwhether deploying virtualized environments, automating tasks with **Python and PowerShell**, or experimenting with **Infrastructure as Code** using **Terraform and CloudFormation**.  

I bring a combination of **technical expertise, strong communication skills, and a collaborative mindset** to every project I undertake. I value precision, security, and efficiency, and I approach each challenge with a methodical yet innovative perspective.  

Looking forward, I am particularly interested in how **AI and machine learning can enhance cloud engineering and cybersecurity practices**. By integrating AI-driven insights with my existing knowledge of infrastructure, compliance, and security frameworks, I aim to help organizations build systems that are not only reliable but also intelligent, resilient, and effective.

## üíº 2025 Internship with InfusionPoints
During my internship at **InfusionPoints**, I supported cross-functional teams across the **Security Operations Center (SOC), Advisory, Cloud Operations, and Engineering** departments. This role provided hands-on exposure to cloud security, compliance, and operations in a consulting environment serving both commercial and federal clients.  

Key contributions included:  
- **Compliance & Documentation:** Conducted research, compiled data, and assisted in the development of security and compliance documentation aligned with **FedRAMP 20X, DoD IL4/IL5, CMMC, and CSP/APN partner requirements**.  
- **Technical Support & Training:** Completed structured onboarding modules and earned **AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner** and **AWS Solutions Architect ‚Äì Associate** certifications, reinforcing my technical foundation in cloud architecture and migration.  
- **Collaboration & Process Improvement:** Worked alongside interns and senior staff on **automation initiatives and process-improvement projects**, contributing ideas to enhance internal workflows and client deliverables.  
- **Engagement & Professionalism:** Actively participated in daily and weekly meetings, documented key action items, and consistently maintained professionalism in alignment with company policies, confidentiality agreements (NDA), and cultural values.  

This internship enabled me to integrate my academic knowledge with practical experience, strengthen my understanding of cloud security and compliance frameworks, and gain a clearer perspective on how cloud engineering, cybersecurity, and compliance intersect in a professional setting.

## üîÆ Future Projects  
As I continue expanding my hands-on experience, I am actively planning projects that combine my background in **cloud engineering, IT infrastructure, and cybersecurity** with emerging technologies such as **Artificial Intelligence**. These projects will serve as both learning opportunities and portfolio showcases.  

Planned initiatives include:  

- **Cloud Migration Lab (AWS Focused)**  
  A step-by-step migration of workloads from an on-premises simulation to AWS using **Application Migration Service (MGN)** and **Database Migration Service (DMS)**. This project will document the full process: assessment, migration, testing, and post-migration optimization.  

- **Infrastructure as Code Starter Kit**  
  Templates using **Terraform** and **AWS CloudFormation** to provision common AWS resources (VPCs, EC2, IAM roles, and S3). This repository will demonstrate reusable, well-documented IaC patterns.  

- **AI-Assisted Cost Optimization on AWS**  
  A project that explores integrating **machine learning models** with AWS billing and usage data to recommend cost-saving strategies (e.g., instance right-sizing, storage tiering).  

- **Security Monitoring with AI + AWS**  
  Using **CloudTrail logs** and AI models to detect unusual login behavior or configuration changes. This project will showcase how AI/ML can enhance **threat detection and incident response**.  

- **Automated Compliance Dashboard**  
  A proof-of-concept tool that maps AWS account configurations against frameworks such as **FedRAMP Moderate** or **NIST 800-53**, highlighting gaps and remediation steps.
